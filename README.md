# ðŸŽ¨ MapEditor

This is a painting application created during the 5th week of the bootcamp Code For All.

### It consists of a grid and a cursor. 

ðŸ”µ To paint, simply navigate to the cell you desire and tap he SPACE key of your keyboard. The selected cell will automatically turn blue. 
If you wish to delete, do the exact same process. Navigate to the desired cell and tap the SPACE key. 

## Future features

As I am still building this app, there are a few other features that I still want to implement, such as:

1. Different keys for different colors.
2. Save and Load.

So, stay tunned!
